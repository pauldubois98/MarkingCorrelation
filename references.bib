	abstract = {Deep learning has been overwhelmingly successful in computer vision (CV), natural language processing, and video/speech recognition. In this paper, our focus is on CV. We provide a critical review of recent achievements in terms of techniques and applications. We identify eight emerging techniques, investigate their origins and updates, and finally emphasize their applications in four key scenarios, including recognition, visual tracking, semantic segmentation, and image restoration. We recognize three development stages in the past decade and emphasize research trends for future works. The summarizations, knowledge accumulations, and creations could benefit researchers in the academia and participators in the CV industries.}

This review paper provides a brief overview of some of the most significant deep learning schemes used in computer vision problems, that is, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks, and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders. A brief account of their history, structure, advantages, and limitations is given, followed by a description of their applications in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, face recognition, action and activity recognition, and human pose estimation. Finally, a brief overview is given of future directions in designing deep learning schemes for computer vision problems and the challenges involved therein.},

Deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various fields. Accordingly, application of deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.}",

After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers.DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8\\%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1\\%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2\\%). However, there was a “long tail” of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8\\% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific.Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).Deep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field.}",

Despite the growing popularity of collaborative assessments, few studies test the differential effects of collaborative assessments (versus traditional assessments) on student learning. This paper analyzes 16 empirical studies from various disciplines and investigates the extent to which collaborative assessments improve student learning. The paper further provides recommendations and improved practices for instructors interested in using collaborative assessment in their classroom.}

	abstract = {The halo effect is a construct reserved to explain individual rater's failure to discriminate among conceptually distinct aspects of a stimulus person's behavior. One hundred twenty-eight students from three communication courses evaluated a college professor by completing items measuring nonverbal immediacy, teaching effectiveness, and attitudes toward course content. Students also completed two items considered irrelevant to teaching effectiveness: vocal clarity and physical attractiveness. Significant inter-correlations were found (ranging from 0.28 to 0.72) among all five measures indicating the presence of a halo effect. Moreover, relationships between the two irrelevant measures and nonverbal immediacy, teaching effectiveness and course affect were somewhat stronger when the two irrelevant items were placed at the end of the survey. The results were discussed and implications for halo effects in student evaluations of communication instruction were considered.}
