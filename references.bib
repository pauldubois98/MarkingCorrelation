	abstract = {Deep learning has been overwhelmingly successful in computer vision (CV), natural language processing, and video/speech recognition. In this paper, our focus is on CV. We provide a critical review of recent achievements in terms of techniques and applications. We identify eight emerging techniques, investigate their origins and updates, and finally emphasize their applications in four key scenarios, including recognition, visual tracking, semantic segmentation, and image restoration. We recognize three development stages in the past decade and emphasize research trends for future works. The summarizations, knowledge accumulations, and creations could benefit researchers in the academia and participators in the CV industries.}

	abstract={Over the last years deep learning methods have been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in several fields, with computer vision being one of the most prominent cases. This review paper provides a brief overview of some of the most significant deep learning schemes used in computer vision problems, that is, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks, and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders. A brief account of their history, structure, advantages, and limitations is given, followed by a description of their applications in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, face recognition, action and activity recognition, and human pose estimation. Finally, a brief overview is given of future directions in designing deep learning schemes for computer vision problems and the challenges involved therein.},

	abstract = "{This article methodically reviews the literature on deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain, providing quantitative analysis to answer 3 research questions concerning methods, scope, and context of current research.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers.DL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8\\%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1\\%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2\\%). However, there was a “long tail” of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8\\% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific.Our analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).Deep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field.}",
