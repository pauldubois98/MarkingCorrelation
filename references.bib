	abstract = {Deep learning has been overwhelmingly successful in computer vision (CV), natural language processing, and video/speech recognition. In this paper, our focus is on CV. We provide a critical review of recent achievements in terms of techniques and applications. We identify eight emerging techniques, investigate their origins and updates, and finally emphasize their applications in four key scenarios, including recognition, visual tracking, semantic segmentation, and image restoration. We recognize three development stages in the past decade and emphasize research trends for future works. The summarizations, knowledge accumulations, and creations could benefit researchers in the academia and participators in the CV industries.}

	abstract={Over the last years deep learning methods have been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in several fields, with computer vision being one of the most prominent cases. This review paper provides a brief overview of some of the most significant deep learning schemes used in computer vision problems, that is, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks, and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders. A brief account of their history, structure, advantages, and limitations is given, followed by a description of their applications in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, face recognition, action and activity recognition, and human pose estimation. Finally, a brief overview is given of future directions in designing deep learning schemes for computer vision problems and the challenges involved therein.},
